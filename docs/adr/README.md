# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the
Nebari Landing project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR is a document that captures an important architectural decision
made along with its context and consequences. We use the
[MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/) (Markdown Any Decision Record)
format.

## ADR Index
